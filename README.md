# Professional-Portfolio

## What is it?
This set of webpages represent a portfolio for myself, featuring a brief professional statement, four projects I have worked on, my resume, and contact information.

The "About Me" page features my headshot and professional statement.

The "Portfolio" page presents four of my projects. All but "Food For Thought" were done independently - "Food For Thought" was a group project. By clicking on the project's picture or name, a separate tabe will appear with the deployed project. By clicking any of the "Code" links, you will be brought to the appropriate Github page.

The "Contact" page features my contact infromation, as well as links to my resume, Linkedin profile, and Github profile. 

This website utilizes Twitter Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Bootstrap Social.
